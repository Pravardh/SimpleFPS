# SimpleFPS
This is a simple first person shooter game written in Unity and C# with no tutorials or external assets used!

# Motive

I took it upon myself to make a game in Unity and C# in 2 hours without using any tutorials or third party assets.
All the code you see here is written entirely by me

# Features Used

This project uses concepts like:-
1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Character Controllers
3. Shooting with Raycasts
4. Level Design
5. Post processing
6. Win/Loss Conditions
7. Encapsulation
8. Unity Particle System
etc.

I tried to put a lot of emphasis on Object Oriented Programming, and I made my code bases as scallable as possible.

# Goal

You basically should not let the AI Character (Cylinder) touch the player. If it does, you lose.
